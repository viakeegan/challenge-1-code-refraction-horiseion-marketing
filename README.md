# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This week's challenge involved an important aspect of web development: accessibility. This challenge demonstrated the Scout Rule, which involved refractoring the code to meet the Acceptance Criteria. The client Horiseon Marketing, wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is fully optimized for SEO.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards <br />
WHEN I view the source code <br />
THEN I find semantic HTML elements <br />
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements <br />
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning <br />
WHEN I view the image elements <br />
THEN I find accessible alt attributes <br />
WHEN I view the heading attributes <br />
THEN they fall in sequential order <br />
WHEN I view the title element <br />
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title <br />
